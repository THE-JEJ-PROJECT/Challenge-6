In this step, walls are created to form the boundaries of the game stage. Side walls and corner walls are configured to handle different collision events later on:

Floor panels are added in a 4x4 grid to form the base of the stage. Each panel is a separate game object that can be individually destroyed. These floor panels give the player a platform, which will disappear as part of the game mechanics:

Four enemy spawners are placed in each corner of the stage. These spawners are set to spawn enemies until a specific limit is reached. The placement in the corners allows enemies to enter the game from multiple directions:

When the player shoots a wall, an event is triggered that changes the wallâ€™s color to red:

With each wall hit, a random floor panel is deleted:

Different events are triggered based on whether the player hits a side wall or a corner wall. Hitting a side wall removes a single random floor panel, while hitting a corner wall removes all remaining floor panels at once:

A Rainspawner is added above the stage, dropping raindrops onto the play area. These raindrops interact with other elements. This mechanic adds an additional obstacle for the player.
